This folder contains startup scripts for various distributions to
start GnuGk automatically when the server starts.

Recent distributions mostly use Systemd, so you can place
systemd.gnugk.service as gnugk.service into /etc/systemd/system.

On older distributions that use the Initd system, the scripts must
usually be renamed to 'gnugk' and placed into
the folder /etc/rc.d or /etc/init.d .

If you modify one of these scripts to work with your distribution,
please send them in to jan@willamowius.de or post them on the mailinglist.

OpenSuSE:   use gk.initd.suse12 for 12.x (with SysVInit, not systemd), gk.initd.suse10 for 10.x and gk.initd.suse for 9.x
CentOS:     use gk.initd.redhat, gk.initd.centos53, gk.initd.centos65 or gk.initd.centos7
MacOS X:	use gnugk.plist and place it in /Library/LaunchDaemons/
